# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this activity was to show the ability to retrieve weather data, create a travel destinations map and to create a travel itinerary map.

### Results

Initially the assignment was to create a database that included hotel, city, country, max temperature and current weather description details.  Then I displayed this information on a map after specifying weather criteria.

Once I had a map of potential vacation destinations based on weather, I could then choose four destinations I would like to travel to.

I was then able to create a map that showed the details for each destination.

### Conclusion

If I want to be somewhere warm during this time of year, I need to travel South.
